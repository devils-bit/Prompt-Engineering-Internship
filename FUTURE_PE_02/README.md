Prompt 1: Generating Viral Hooks:

"Act as a viral content strategist for Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. I need to market an IT Training Institute named 'Built Different' that helps college students get high-paying tech jobs.

Target Audience: Frustrated engineering students and fresh graduates in India.
Goal: Drive sign-ups for a free 'Full Stack Demo Class'.

Task: Write 3 distinct 'Scroll-Stopping Hooks' (first 3 seconds).

The Negative Hook: (e.g., 'Stop wasting time on...')

The Salary Hook: (Focusing on the outcome/package)

The Reality Check Hook: (Hard truth about college degrees vs. skills)

Keep them under 15 words each."

output:

---

### 1️⃣ Negative Hook

**“Stop wasting 4 years on a degree that won’t pay you.”**

---

### 2️⃣ Salary Hook

**“Want a ₹12 LPA tech job before graduation?”**

---

### 3️⃣ Reality Check Hook

**“Your college gives a degree. Companies pay for skills.”**

---

observation:
"I specifically requested three distinct psychological triggers (Negative, Outcome, and Reality Check) to test which angle stops the scroll most effectively. I set a strict constraint of 'under 15 words' because short-form algorithms penalize videos with slow openings."

Prompt 2: The Full UGC Script (PAS Framework):

"Great. Now, take Hook #3 (The Reality Check) and write a full 60-second UGC (User Generated Content) script.

Format:

Visual: Describe what the actor is doing (e.g., 'Holding a degree looking confused', 'Pointing to a green screen showing job offers').

Audio: The spoken script.

Structure:

Hook: The Reality Check.

Problem: Why a degree alone isn't getting them hired.

Solution: Built Different's practical project-based training.

CTA: 'Link in bio for a free demo'."

output:

## 🎬 UGC SCRIPT – “Reality Check”

---

### 🎯 HOOK (0–5 sec)

**Visual:**
Holding a degree certificate… looking confused. Text on screen: *“Reality Check.”*

**Audio:**
“Your college gives you a degree… but companies pay for skills.”

---

### 😓 PROBLEM (5–25 sec)

**Visual:**
Cut to actor scrolling LinkedIn job posts. Zoom into requirements: *‘2+ years experience’, ‘React, Node, AWS’*.
Actor shakes head.

**Audio:**
“I realized this the hard way. I had the marks. I had the certificate.
But every job description wanted skills I was never actually taught.
React. Node. Real-world projects. Intern-level experience.
And I’m sitting there with just theory and lab records.”

---

**Visual:**
Actor closing laptop in frustration. Text on screen: *‘Degree ≠ Job’*

**Audio:**
“Engineering colleges prepare you to pass exams.
Companies hire you to solve real problems.”

---

### 🚀 SOLUTION (25–50 sec)

**Visual:**
Cut to energetic tone. Actor coding on laptop. Quick cuts of:
– Building a website
– GitHub profile
– Mock interview practice
– Group project discussion

Text on screen: *“Built Different – Full Stack Training”*

**Audio:**
“That’s when I found Built Different.
They don’t just teach theory.
You build real full-stack projects.
You create a proper portfolio.
You practice interviews.
You learn what companies actually ask.”

---

**Visual:**
Show fake notification: *‘Congratulations! Shortlisted for Interview 🎉’*

**Audio:**
“They train you like you’re already in the industry.”

---

### 🔥 CTA (50–60 sec)

**Visual:**
Actor pointing to screen bottom. Text on screen: *‘Free Full Stack Demo Class’*

**Audio:**
“If you’re tired of being just another engineering graduate…
It’s time to be Built Different.

Free full-stack demo class.
Link in bio.”

---

observation:
"I used the PAS Framework (Problem-Agitation-Solution) to structure the script. This ensures the content doesn't just sell a course, but first validates the user's frustration (the 'Problem' of having a degree but no job) before presenting 'Built Different' as the logical solution. Including visual cues makes the script ready for an editor immediately."

Prompt 3: Platform Adaptation:
"Now, adapt this same core message for a LinkedIn Text Ad (not a video script).

Tone: Professional, career-focused, and encouraging.

Format: A text post with a clear headline and bullet points.

Change: Instead of 'hype', focus on 'upskilling' and 'career gaps'.

CTA: 'Register for the Demo Class below'."

output:
## 🚨 Reality Check for Engineering Students & Fresh Graduates

Your college gives you a degree.
Employers hire for **skills, problem-solving ability, and real project experience**.

Many talented students struggle to land interviews — not because they lack intelligence, but because of a **career gap between academics and industry expectations**.

### The Gap:

* Strong theoretical knowledge, limited practical exposure
* No real-world Full Stack projects
* Low confidence in technical interviews
* Resume without industry-relevant experience

### The Solution: Built Different – Industry-Focused Full Stack Training

At **Built Different**, we focus on structured upskilling:

* ✅ Hands-on Full Stack development (React, Node, APIs, Databases)
* ✅ Real-world, portfolio-ready projects
* ✅ GitHub profile building
* ✅ Mock interviews & placement-oriented preparation
* ✅ Clear roadmap from student to job-ready candidate

Our goal is simple:
Help you transition from **degree-holder** to **job-ready professional**.

If you’re serious about closing your skill gap and preparing for high-growth tech roles, this is your starting point.

observation:
"I shifted the persona and tone from 'viral strategist' to 'professional mentor' to suit the LinkedIn audience. While Instagram rewards high-energy hooks, LinkedIn rewards value-driven, career-focused advice. This demonstrates the ability to repurpose core content for different platforms."
